Hello World!

I'm a Software Engineer with a bit of Data Engineering experience and I love code.
In my spare time I also like to dabble in Strongman and have the occasional whisky.
Apparently Software Engineers make blogs or something? So here is mine I guess. 

<br/>

Hopefully something here can be of use to you.
